#UCF Coding Bootcamp Project #1

##Drink & Dine
####Search for food and drink recipes or focus on one using the boolean slider and buttons. 
Enter the food or drink ingredients you already have on hand (i.e. meat, seasoning,
and dairy).  Use a single alcohol ingredient, such as tequila or rum for cocktails.  Other 
ingredients, such as mint or orange juice can be used to find cocktail and non-alcoholic drinks.
As a reminder, help is activated and deactivated with a modal window popup.    

The project was divided by tasks into frontend, food API and drink API development.  Backend 
development, though minimal, connected the Firebase open database to capture search strings
in realtime and was used to display the last, previous search for either food or drinks.

Future development could include specialized food searches by dietary restriction or preference,
calorie count and other nutritional information.

Challenges faced by the development team were overcome by the use of jquery and ajax calls to edamam.com for 
food; similarly, the drinks utilized thecocktaildb.com. While the query of edemam.com (food) followed 
the rules for manipulating arrays within the object, thecocktaildb.com object contained an array with objects 
with objects that used repeating name groups. Blank, non-valided, entries contained in the object became a 
unique challenge and many hours were put into solving the dilemma.  In the end, the eval() function allowed 
the conversion of strings back into javascript and provided the best method to capture ingredient and quantity 
details within the code.  

Frontend development utilized Bootstrap, with additional libraries from the W3.CSS reference library
for style.  This gave the final produce the mobile-ready, finished look that we were seeking.

This project was challenging and provided mostly, novice, coders with a full compliment of issues that 
added to the learning experience.  Special thanks to UCF Coding Bootcamp instructor, Michael Pascuzzi and 
TA's Karina Mills and Alex Robinson, for their encouragement, guidance and support. 

Addition, the special, prodigious skills of Christian Cotham, helped to guide the relatively smooth development
of this product.  The team, which also included Luna Routsong, Muktiar Indrees and Ronald Antonio were priviledge
to work tirelessly to make this deadline happen.
