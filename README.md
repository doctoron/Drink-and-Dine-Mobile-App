# Project-1

UCF Coding Bootcamp Project #1

The overall application’s concept is to have user start by entering ingredients you already have on hand such as meat, seasoning and dairy). As you add available ingredients, our website suggests recipes, updating results for each new item you include. Same thing for the drinks section.
The motivation for its development to help you waste less food and eat fantastic meals and drinks. Trying to keep it simple and effective.
Your design process uses the Bootstrap styling with the background to appease the user to show a tabled familar background ; such as a kitchen table. Also a Button allows user to switch between drinks and food depending on what user preference is.
